# Personal Website
This is the repository to hold my personal website, my home on the internet, a place to aggregate and track all that is me.  My [blog](https://rchillard.com/) is primarily here to *learn in public* and track my progress.  Here are the topics that I'll write about here:
* Agile and DevOps (Thoughts on Teams, Human Psychology)
* Infrastructure (Linux, Docker, Cloud Work, Serverless)
* Web Development (Node, React, Lots of JavaScript)
