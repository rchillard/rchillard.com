# Personal Website
This is the repository to hold my personal website, my home on the internet, a place to aggregate and track all that is me.  My [blog](https://rchillard.com/) is primarily here to *learn in public* and track my progress.  Here are the topics that I'll write about here:
* Agile and DevOps
** Human Psychology
** Thoughts on Teams
* Infrastructure
** Docker
** Linux
** Serverless
* Web Development
** JavaScript
** Node
** React
