    <h1>About RCH</h1>
    <p>January 1, 2025</p>
    <p>This is my embrace of learning in public as inspired by Shawn Wang. The idea behind learning in public is that you learn more effectively by being open about what you don't know, by adding to the corpus of human knowledge, and by digesting concepts and explaining them in your own words.<sup><a href="https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public/">1</a></sup></p>
    <p>This site is a way for me to digest my own learning. It's primarily here for future me, and it's how I plan on:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Tracing my journey</li>
      <li>Capturing important concepts</li>
      <li>Showcasing the projects I've built</li>
      <li>Teaching back to the universe the lessons I've learned</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I write everything from essays on leadership and articles tracing my software development journey to full technical guides to tiny thought snippets.</p>
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>I grew up fascinated by technology and was fortunate enough to learn the fundamentals of programming a long, long time ago, when the internet was new. Since then, I have spent most of my professional career in the service of software development teams. I have served in roles as an architect, business analyst, developer, lead developer, project manager, quality tester, scrum master, and team coach. I've made a lot of mistakes along the way.</p>
    <h2>Technology</h2>
    <p>I supported dev teams for years, before finally scratching the itch in 2018 and getting back into the hands-on fun of coding. I love software, because I believe it's modern day magic. But I'm a sorcerer that is just now waking up to the dangers of casting big spells using shiny objects (frameworks), depending on different reagents (dependencies), and after trying modern web development for the last 9 years, I think it feels like this:</p>
    <img alt="The cartoon wizard Merlin facing a large red crocodile opening its mouth" src="./img/merlin-facing-crocodile.jpg">
    <cite>The Sword in the Stone (1963)</cite>
    <p>I am waking up to the dangers of modern "best" practices, and returning to sustainable approaches by focusing on fundamentals while getting back into the magic of forging my own spells.</p>
    <p>Follow me on my quest to discover magic again by reading <a href="index.html">my home page.</a></p>
