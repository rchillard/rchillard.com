The\n      idea behind learning in public is that you learn more effectively by being\n      open about what you don't know, by adding to the corpus of human\n      knowledge, and by digesting concepts and explaining them in your own\n      words.<sup>1</sup> This site is a way for me to digest my own learning.\n      It's primarily here for future me, and it's how I plan on:\n    </p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Tracing my journey</li>\n      <li>Capturing important concepts</li>\n      <li>Showcasing the projects I've built</li>\n      <li>Teaching back to the universe the lessons I've learned</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>\n      I write essays on leadership, articles on infrastructure, and posts on\n      software development.\n    </p>\n    <h2>My Background</h2>\n    <p>\n      I grew up fascinated by technology and was fortunate enough to learn the\n      fundamentals of programming a long, long time ago, when the internet was\n      new. Since then, I have spent most of my professional career in the\n      service of software development teams. I have served in roles as a\n      business analyst, project manager, quality tester, scrum master, and team\n      coach. I've made a lot of mistakes along the way.\n    </p>\n    <h2>Leadership</h2>\n    <p>\n      From those mistakes, I write essays sharing hard lessons I've learned, so\n      that I can improve how project managers, scrum masters, and team leads\n      think about, interact with, and understand their development teams. My\n      writing focuses on how to effectively lead and organize really smart\n      humans.\n    </p>\n    <h2>Technology</h2>\n    <p>\n      Although I've supported dev teams for years, I keep itching to get back to\n      the hands-on fun of coding. I love software, because I believe it's{\" \"}\n      <strong>modern day magic</strong>. But I'm a sorcerer that hasn't cast a\n      serious spell in years, and trying to dive back in, I've found that modern\n      web development can feel like this:\n    </p>\n    <img\n      src={merlin}\n      alt=\"Merlin facing Crocodile\"\n      style={{ marginBottom: \"0\" }}\n    />\n    <p style={{ textAlign: \"right\" }}>The Sword in the Stone (1963)</p>\n    <p>\n      I am shaking off that rust, learning modern practices, and getting back\n      into the magic of casting spells.
