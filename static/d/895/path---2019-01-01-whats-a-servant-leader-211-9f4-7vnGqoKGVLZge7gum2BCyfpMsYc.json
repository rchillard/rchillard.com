{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Servant-leadership as a term was originally coined by Robert K. Greenleaf in the 1970s.  Wikipedia defines Mr. Greenleaf's philosophy and approach to leadership as being different from traditional leadership:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is different from traditional leadership where the leader's main focus is the thriving of their company or organizations. A Servant Leader shares power, puts the needs of the employees first and helps people develop and perform as highly as possible[1]. Servant leadership inverts the norm, which puts the customer service associates as a main priority. Instead of the people working to serve the leader, the leader exists to serve the people[2].</p>\n</blockquote>","timeToRead":1,"frontmatter":{"title":"What's a Servant-Leader?","date":"January 01, 2019","tags":["servant-leader"]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2019/01/01-whats-a-servant-leader/","prev":"/2018/12/27-a-new-language-javascript/","next":"/2019/01/07-whats-a-shortstack-developer/"}}
