{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Much like yesterday's post on the keyword 'this', the keyword 'new' is essential to object oriented programming in JavaScript.  </p>\n<p>What does 'new' actually do though?  This post breaks it down simply:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Creates an empty object</li>\n<li>Sets 'this' = the empty object</li>\n<li>Adds an instruction to return this to the end of the function that follows it</li>\n<li>Adds a \"<strong>proto</strong>\" property to the empty object which links to constructor function</li>\n</ol>\n<p>That's it!  Keeping this in mind will really help you understand what context you're in when using the keyword 'this', which is why these two posts were done back-to-back.  'This' and 'new' are inseparable parts of JavaScript.</p>","timeToRead":1,"frontmatter":{"title":"Keyword 'new' in JavaScript","date":"Nov 26, 2018","tags":["learn","javascript"]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2018/11-26-keyword-new-in-javascript/","prev":"/2018/11-25-keyword-this-in-javascript/","next":"/2018/11-28-power-over-distraction/"}}
