{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Servant leadership was originally defined in the 1970s as a departure from traditional leadership:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This (servant leadership) is different from traditional leadership where the leader's main focus is the thriving of their company or organizations. A Servant Leader shares power, puts the needs of the employees first and helps people develop and perform as highly as possible. Servant leadership inverts the norm, which puts the customer service associates as a main priority. Instead of the people working to serve the leader, the leader exists to serve the people.<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In software development, servant leadership has seen a renaissance through the adoption of agile. I was originally introduced to servant leadership as a formal practice through my training as a scrum master.  Scrum masters are focused on being the sheep dogs of their team, protecting them from outside forces and distractions, so that they can focus on the work at hand.  </p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/b9ff475b2947d1f1c74fc3a9d51141c0/54405/federica-giusti-575480-unsplash.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 784px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 66.58514895509116%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"Sheep Dog in front of Sheep\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/b9ff475b2947d1f1c74fc3a9d51141c0/7922e/federica-giusti-575480-unsplash.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/b9ff475b2947d1f1c74fc3a9d51141c0/e98df/federica-giusti-575480-unsplash.jpg 196w,\n/static/b9ff475b2947d1f1c74fc3a9d51141c0/86c25/federica-giusti-575480-unsplash.jpg 392w,\n/static/b9ff475b2947d1f1c74fc3a9d51141c0/7922e/federica-giusti-575480-unsplash.jpg 784w,\n/static/b9ff475b2947d1f1c74fc3a9d51141c0/86edd/federica-giusti-575480-unsplash.jpg 1176w,\n/static/b9ff475b2947d1f1c74fc3a9d51141c0/ea384/federica-giusti-575480-unsplash.jpg 1568w,\n/static/b9ff475b2947d1f1c74fc3a9d51141c0/872f0/federica-giusti-575480-unsplash.jpg 2352w,\n/static/b9ff475b2947d1f1c74fc3a9d51141c0/54405/federica-giusti-575480-unsplash.jpg 4498w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 784px) 100vw, 784px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<p>For traditionally trained project managers, this inversion of power can feel odd at first.  For me, it felt very natural.  Becoming a scrum master, being tasked first and foremost with removing impediments for my team, I felt empowered to be a real leader.</p>\n<p>By changing the definition of leadership, I found a more natural role for myself.</p>\n<h1>What really is a Servant Leader though?</h1>\n<p>For me, being a servant leader means trusting my team (a group of really smart people) to make reasoned decisions without me.  This release of control is the starting differentiator between a traditional <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_and_control\">command and control</a> leadership style and a servant's approach.  Under a command and control organization, the team is only as smart as the empowered decision maker.  In an organization where leaders serve, the decision making is decentralized, meaning the team's intelligence is pooled.</p>\n<p>As an aside, command and control has its place in the world (such as in the military where decisive action matters in seconds and minutes and not hours and days), but in software development, where groups of really smart people are focused on solving complex problems in a sustainable, repeatable manner, I believe servant leadership is king.  To contrast against my previous assertion, Simon Sinek in his book Leaders Eat Last studies a unit from the Marine Corps, and explains very clearly how their leaders act as servant leaders, thereby building trust, and resulting in better teams.<sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup></p>\n<p>Up until now, servant leadership has been defined in high level ideas and concepts.  In researching other explanations of servant leadership, I found there are hardly any real world examples.  I wanted this post to serve as a knowledge building block for my essays on leadership.  If the rest of these posts are anything, then they'll be explorations of servant leadership, so starting here with a definition feels right.  I also wanted to add some real world grit to my explanation, so you can see the stark contrast yourself.</p>\n<h1>Real World Examples</h1>\n<h2>Borrowed vs. Owned Time</h2>\n<p>If you are a leader that is seeking to <em>minimize</em> your team member's compensation, then you are treating your team as a commodity.  Commodities can be bought and sold, they are fungible, and if you think of your team as a commodity, then by extension, you think you can treat people like you own their time.  Except there's a problem, because humans are not commodities, you cannot own their time, and focused, entrusted teams together are greater than the sum of their parts.  As a servant leader, you should be seeking to maximize compensation for your team members, whether that be in literal financial terms, learning new skills, or being eligible for more vacation time.  You need to remember that you're borrowing time from them.  You never own it.</p>\n<p>This person first attitude will yield results in surprising ways.  </p>\n<p>In a previous job, I needed a middle or senior level developer for a key project, but I took a chance on a junior software developer straight out of college.  Except for being green, this person had all the right makings of a great team member: a resilient attitude, killer work ethic, empathy in spades, and an amazing sense of humor.  After 6 months working on our project, this person had become a core part of our team and a huge contributor.  After a year, this person came to me and professed that they wanted to stay with the team, but because of their personal situation, they needed to make a career move to increase their compensation.</p>\n<p>As a leader, I had a choice.  I could string them along, try to sell them a misdirected tale about the job market, scare this person into staying.  I could treat this person as a commodity, as someone whose time I owned.  Or, I could remember that I had borrowed this person's time, that they were on a larger, longer journey, and that we were just fortunate enough to partake in a small part of it.</p>\n<p>I decided to be a steward.  I counseled this person in the new job opportunity they were considering, and when they asked me, \"Do you think I should take it?  Is it a good idea?  Would you do it?\"  I said, \"Yes, yes, and yes!\"  Their new opportunity was a significant increase in wages (which our organization could not match or compete with), and it was a big move for this person's career in terms of skills and professional development.  It was a no brainer.</p>\n<p>They left us.</p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/fb6d28514af2b9dd5e2598a691e058a3/d4084/mantas-hesthaven-135478-unsplash.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 784px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 71.55635062611807%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"Man leaving with suitcase\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/fb6d28514af2b9dd5e2598a691e058a3/7922e/mantas-hesthaven-135478-unsplash.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/fb6d28514af2b9dd5e2598a691e058a3/e98df/mantas-hesthaven-135478-unsplash.jpg 196w,\n/static/fb6d28514af2b9dd5e2598a691e058a3/86c25/mantas-hesthaven-135478-unsplash.jpg 392w,\n/static/fb6d28514af2b9dd5e2598a691e058a3/7922e/mantas-hesthaven-135478-unsplash.jpg 784w,\n/static/fb6d28514af2b9dd5e2598a691e058a3/86edd/mantas-hesthaven-135478-unsplash.jpg 1176w,\n/static/fb6d28514af2b9dd5e2598a691e058a3/ea384/mantas-hesthaven-135478-unsplash.jpg 1568w,\n/static/fb6d28514af2b9dd5e2598a691e058a3/872f0/mantas-hesthaven-135478-unsplash.jpg 2352w,\n/static/fb6d28514af2b9dd5e2598a691e058a3/d4084/mantas-hesthaven-135478-unsplash.jpg 5590w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 784px) 100vw, 784px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<p>We lost a huge contributor, someone we had invested in, and someone that I needed for a key project in my program.  I was back in the market for a mid or senior level team member.</p>\n<p>But then something surprising happened...</p>\n<h2>Decision Makers vs. Decision Listeners</h2>\n<p>Queen of England and Prime Minister</p>\n<h2>My Team vs. Our Team</h2>\n<p>You can spot a leader that takes stewardship seriously, owning the idea down into their core, by how they refer to their team.  How do you refer to the team you work on?  Do you actually act as their steward?  Here's a very simple way of telling:</p>\n<p>Do you say?</p>\n<p>\"This is <em>my</em> team.\"</p>\n<p>Or, do you say?</p>\n<p>\"This is <em>our</em> team.\"</p>\n<p>It may seem like overkill to focus on such minute language, but I've found that when teaching scrum masters, developing other servant leaders, attitudes shine through in the most subtle of ways.</p>\n<p>Try making it \"our team\" instead of \"your team\" and see how your attitude changes!</p>\n<h2>Open vs. Compartmentalized Information</h2>\n<p>I used to work for a decision maker who often times withheld information from me or fed me information in very targeted and specific ways.  I didn't realize it at the time, because I was wrapped up in the organization's politics, but I was being manipulated more than I knew.  This became clear during a following out between two senior leaders when</p>\n<p>Servant leaders equip teams with maximal information, so that they can make better decisions.</p>\n<p>Traditional leaders target information, assuming they know what's best for the team.</p>\n<h2>Succession Planning</h2>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1\">\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servant_leadership\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servant_leadership</a></p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-2\">\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Leaders-Eat-Last-Together-Others/dp/1543614620\">https://www.amazon.com/Leaders-Eat-Last-Together-Others/dp/1543614620</a></p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-2\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>","timeToRead":5,"frontmatter":{"title":"What's a Servant Leader?","date":"January 01, 2019","tags":["servant-leader"]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2019/01/01-whats-a-servant-leader/","prev":"/2018/12/27-a-new-language-javascript/","next":"/2019/01/07-whats-a-shortstack-developer/"}}
