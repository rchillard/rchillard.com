{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>I wanted to take a second to capture a basic guide for myself on RESTful routing.  REST stands for Representational State Transfer and is essentially a design pattern for creating web services.  To future me, this table should help with any future REST API design:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>URL Path</th>\n<th>Method</th>\n<th>Action</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Index</td>\n<td>/dogs</td>\n<td>GET</td>\n<td>List all dogs</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>New</td>\n<td>/dogs/new</td>\n<td>GET</td>\n<td>Form to create new dog</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Create</td>\n<td>/dogs</td>\n<td>POST</td>\n<td>Add new dog to database</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Show</td>\n<td>/dogs/:id</td>\n<td>GET</td>\n<td>Show a single dog's data</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Edit</td>\n<td>/dogs/:id/edit</td>\n<td>GET</td>\n<td>Show edit form for a dog</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Update</td>\n<td>/dogs/:id</td>\n<td>PUT</td>\n<td>Update a single dog data</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Destroy</td>\n<td>/dogs/:id</td>\n<td>DELETE</td>\n<td>Remove a single dog data</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>It's important to memorize this pattern, because the predictability in it is the basis for many web services.  If you understand REST, and a RESTful API has been designed, then you can expect this type of pattern and more easily integrate with it.</p>","timeToRead":1,"frontmatter":{"title":"RESTful Routing Reference","date":"Nov 23, 2018","tags":["learn","rest","api","reference"]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2018/11/23-restful-routing-reference/","prev":"/2018/11/22-anatomy-of-an-http-request/","next":"/2018/11/24-framework-vs-library/"}}
