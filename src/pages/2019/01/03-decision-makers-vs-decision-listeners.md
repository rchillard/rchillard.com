Agency is the capacity of an actor to act in a given environment.  Organizations with heavily centralized decision making are creating environments where their best equipped team members (those on their front lines) actually have no capacity to act, no agency.

Decentralizing decision making means pushing decision making closer to the people solving problems.  When you step back and think about it like that, it seems plain, logical, and straightforward.  Shouldn't the people who understand the problem be the ones deciding how it gets solved?  It *sounds* painfully obvious, yet organizations constantly make the mistake of taking agency away from the people who are the most capable of exercising it.
 
I've made that mistake too, and I want to tell you about it here.

# Decision Listening
I struggled to establish a proper quality assurance program at my organization for an entire year.  We hired fantastic outside talent to help me setup the program, and I contracted top tier quality assurance engineers and testers.  Even though I had excellent staff, ample tools, and a directive to improve the quality across our program, I did not have the wisdom to give them their own agency.  I maintained my own testing philosophy and ideas about how quality should be assessed.  I insisted on being in the meetings, even on being a part of some low level decision making (such as what test frameworks to be used).

We had hired great staff and equipped them to succeed, but I had foolishly kept my hands on the reins.  I was an over involved manager, and I couldn't see it, but I had robbed this awesome team of their agency.  I had kept decision making out of the hands of the people most capable of making good decisions.

I decided to try something new: decision listening.

Decision listening is simply the practice of listening to your team deliberate and instead of intervening to *make a decision*, patiently waiting and letting them reason through a problem.  For someone who wants a problem decisively solved, this can be *excruciating*.
