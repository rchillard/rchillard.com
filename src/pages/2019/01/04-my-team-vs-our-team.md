## Open vs. Compartmentalized Information
I used to work for a decision maker who often times withheld information from me or fed me information in very targeted and specific ways.  I didn't realize it at the time, because I was wrapped up in the organization's politics, but I was being manipulated more than I knew.  This became clear during a following out between two senior leaders when

Servant leaders equip teams with maximal information, so that they can make better decisions.

Traditional leaders target information, assuming they know what's best for the team.

## My Team vs. Our Team
You can spot a leader that takes stewardship seriously, owning the idea down into their core, by how they refer to their team.  How do you refer to the team you work on?  Do you actually act as their steward?  Here's a very simple way of telling:

Do you say?

"This is *my* team."

Or, do you say?

"This is *our* team."

It may seem like overkill to focus on such minute language, but I've found that when teaching scrum masters, developing other servant leaders, attitudes shine through in the most subtle of ways.

Try making it "our team" instead of "your team" and see how your attitude changes!
