## Steps

### Determine viability of location
1. Check for wall stud
2. Check for fire break
3. Measure length of cable

## Inventory


## Finding the right wall
Find landmarks such as lights and air vents that you can use to determine where your socket is going to go.
Measure the distance and count the studs as precisely as you can

## Attic Exploration
First, go up in your attic and chart out your path to do network cabling *without* any tools in hand.  Sweep out of the way insulation, so you have a clear pathway to the locations you will need.
