I said yesterday that I was going to need more leather for this effort.  Here's the good news: I found a [tanner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanning_(leather)).  This tanner's name is the amazing Gatsby plugin system.  I know you were probably wondering: how is this basic starter blog doing so much cool stuff?  

The magic of Gatsby plugins!

Although I'm a neophyte, the Gatsby plugin system feels very robust from the get go.  Here's a set of improvements that I've implemented, which I would recommend checking out for your own projects:
* Font themeing support with [gatsby-plugin-typography](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-typography/)
* Code blocks and syntax highlighting from [gatsby-remark-prismjs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-remark-prismjs/)
* Get them sweet emojis :ice_cream: in play with [gatsby-remark-emojis](https://github.com/matchilling/gatsby-remark-emojis)

I've changed my typography theme to [Noriega](https://github.com/KyleAMathews/typography.js/tree/master/packages/typography-theme-noriega)
