## Exponentiation Operator **
A real math operator for exponents!  How'd it take so many years?
```javascript
var calculatedNumber = 2**4
calculatedNumber // 16
```

## [].includes
Remember the .includes function introduced for Strings in ES2015?  Well, ES2016 capitalizes on that victory by adding a [].includes method that works exactly as the String method does, except on Arrays!
```javascript
var nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
nums.includes(2) // true
nums.includes(7) // false
```
